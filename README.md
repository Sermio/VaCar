<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  <strong>VaCar</strong> is a mobile application developed in Flutter to streamline veterinary clinic management. It enables veterinarians to manage orders, schedule appointments, and maintain detailed records of clients and pets, enhancing efficiency and simplifying operations.
  <br><br>
  The application centralizes user creation by an administrator. Veterinarians can create, edit, and delete orders, view assignments, and track order status, including the veterinarian's location en route. This facilitates seamless communication and reduces wait times.
  <br><br>
  VaCar arose from the need to digitize veterinary processes, replacing the inefficient and potentially unsafe phone-based order management for veterinarians in transit. The application enables centralized management from mobile devices, report generation, and quick sharing via email or WhatsApp.
